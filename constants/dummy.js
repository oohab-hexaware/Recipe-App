      "Grind the coffee beans to a medium-coarse consistency.In a French press or large mason jar, combine the coffee grinds and water. Stir and top with the lid. Steep at room temperature or in the fridge for 12 - 24 hours. The longer it sits, the stronger the coffee taste.To make the vanilla cream, combine the cream, soy milk, vanilla, and agave syrup in a separate jar, and store in the fridge until ready to use.he next day, place a strainer over a bowl lined with cheese cloth (or nut milk bag). Strain the grounds through the cheesecloth. If desired, filter the coffee through a second time to remove any residual ground beans. The liquid that remains in the bowl is now your cold brew coffee concentrate!To make the drink, fill a glass with ice. Then pour in 2 parts cold brew concentrate, 1 part cold water, and 1 part vanilla cream. ",
